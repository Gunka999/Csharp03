1) Create a void delegate Print()
2) Create two methods that will use this delegate:

TranslateMonthName(): for translating name of month;
PrintSeasonName(): for showing name of season;

Then user should enter following data:

a) User should choose number within 1-12. 
b) Create a delegate variable and assign it based on user preference:
   What information he/she wants to know: translated name of month or season name. 
   (use switch statements or expressions)
   
    Based on user choice you should call appropriate method. You're not gonna check by if-else and call them, 
    rather create a variable of delegate and assign it with necessary method. At the end just call (invoke) it.

c) Then create following method and add it to previous delegate variable:
   InfoPrint(): for showing more information about app - just print some info;

   For example:

   Select a month:
   1. January
   2. February
   etc.

   Lets say user chose 1. After..

   Select what information do you want to know?

   1. Translated name of month
   2. Name of season

   User chose 1. The result will be:

   Translated name of month will be: Yanvar;
   Information about app.

   If user chose 2, result would be:
   
   Name of season: Winter;
   Information about app.


d) Change app using lambda expressions.
e) Change app using one of the built-in delegates: Func<>, Action<>, Predicate<>.
